update the employee section to sync with the new changes also it should take two files an excel file which is now it is taking and working   │
│    good and other file should be attendance file so that i get a proper attendance of each employee which done manually by manager so that it   │
│    gives a proper daily present data by days then you calculate the working days by hour with the excel file as i have already done various     │
│    thing just update in that , flow: the admin has uploaded the excel file and a attendance file then a popup will appear to take the month and │
│     total holidays of that month , then if the user was present for 20 days by hours then the holiday should be added to that suppose holiday   │
│    was 5 so 25 of 31 days he was present then he should get 25*258 rupees so update the employee section to get the all details also when i     │
│    click a row the calculation should open instead of going and then clicking the view cal, also as the admin is adding the attendance file so  │
│    i have all the attendance of user then the user should get all the attendance and the data , a calendar with attendance when exposed by      │
│    admin, i have already implemented 50% of code , just update into that
