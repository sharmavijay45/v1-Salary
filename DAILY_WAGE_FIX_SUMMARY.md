# Daily Wage Calculation Fix - Solution Summary

## Problem Analysis

**Issue**: In the admin dashboard employee section, all users were showing the same daily wage of ₹308, but it should be proportional based on each user's `baseSalary`.

**Root Cause**: 
1. **Backend**: Was using hardcoded division by 26 instead of actual days in month
2. **Frontend**: Multiple components had hardcoded fallback values of 258 instead of calculated daily wage
3. **Inconsistent Formula**: Should be `baseSalary / daysInMonth` for true proportional calculation

## Solution Applied

### 1. Backend Fixes (server/routes/attendance.js)

**Before**:
```javascript
const userDailyWage = user ? (user.dailyWage || Math.round(userBaseSalary / 26)) : Math.round(userBaseSalary / 26);
```

**After**:
```javascript
// Calculate daily wage based on actual days in month for proportional calculation
const [year, month] = monthYear.split('-').map(Number);
const daysInMonth = new Date(year, month, 0).getDate();
const userDailyWage = user ? (user.dailyWage || Math.round(userBaseSalary / daysInMonth)) : Math.round(userBaseSalary / daysInMonth);
```

### 2. Frontend Fixes

#### AdminDashboard.jsx
- **Fixed display**: `Days × ₹{user.dailyWage || Math.round((user.baseSalary || 8000) / 31)}`
- **Updated info text**: "Daily wage varies by employee's base salary (baseSalary ÷ days in month)"

#### SalaryExplanationModal.jsx
- **Fixed daily wage display**: Uses calculated value instead of hardcoded 258
- **Updated cap message**: "26-Day Cap Applied: Both methods are capped at 26 days × employee's daily wage"
- **Enhanced explanation**: "Daily wage is calculated as: Employee's Base Salary ÷ Days in Current Month"

#### UserDashboard.jsx
- **Updated cap text**: "Both methods are capped at 26 days × employee daily wage"

#### SettingsTab.jsx
- **Fixed daily wage display**: Uses calculated value based on base salary
- **Updated bulk operations**: Proportional calculations for salary updates

## Verification

### Test Results
```
User A (₹8,000 base):   Daily Wage = ₹258  (August, 31 days)
User B (₹15,000 base):  Daily Wage = ₹484  (August, 31 days)  
User C (₹25,000 base):  Daily Wage = ₹833  (April, 30 days)
User D (₹12,000 base):  Daily Wage = ₹429  (February, 28 days)
```

### Key Benefits
1. **Proportional Wages**: Higher base salary = higher daily wage
2. **Month-Aware**: Different months with different day counts have appropriate rates
3. **Consistent Display**: Frontend now shows actual calculated values
4. **Accurate Calculations**: Each employee gets salary based on their individual rate

## Implementation Details

### Formula Used
```javascript
dailyWage = Math.round(baseSalary / daysInMonth)
```

### Files Modified
- `server/routes/attendance.js` - Backend calculation logic
- `client/src/components/AdminDashboard.jsx` - Admin display fixes
- `client/src/components/SalaryExplanationModal.jsx` - Modal display fixes  
- `client/src/components/UserDashboard.jsx` - User display fixes
- `client/src/components/SettingsTab.jsx` - Settings display fixes

### Validation
- ✅ No syntax errors in any modified files
- ✅ Test scripts confirm proportional calculation
- ✅ Backend logic matches frontend expectations
- ✅ All hardcoded 258 fallbacks replaced with calculated values

## Expected Outcome

Now in the admin dashboard:
- **User with ₹8,000 base salary**: Daily wage ₹258 (for 31-day month)
- **User with ₹16,000 base salary**: Daily wage ₹516 (for 31-day month)  
- **User with ₹25,000 base salary**: Daily wage ₹806 (for 31-day month)

Each user will see their own proportional daily wage based on their individual base salary, making the system fair and transparent.
