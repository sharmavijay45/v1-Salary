## üîß Solution to Login Issues

### Why Users Can't Login Initially
The system uses two separate MongoDB databases:
1. **Source Database** (`blackhole_db`): Contains existing user data from your main company system
2. **Target Database** (`salary_blackhole`): New database specifically for salary management

**Users cannot login initially because their accounts need to be migrated from the source to the target database.**

### How to Fix Login Issues
1. **First-time Setup**: The system will automatically show an admin setup screen if no admin exists
2. **Create Admin Account**: Set up the first admin user who can manage the system
3. **Migrate Users**: Admin must migrate users from the main database using the migration tools
4. **Users Can Login**: After migration, users can login with their existing credentials

### Migration Process
- **Bulk Migration**: Import all users at once from the main database
- **Individual Sync**: Sync specific users by email address
- **Automatic Updates**: System handles password hashing and data formatting

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `MONGODB_URI` | Main database connection | Required |
| `GET_DETAIL_MONGO_URI` | Source database for user migration | Required |
| `JWT_SECRET` | JWT signing secret | Required |
| `GROQ_API_KEY` | Groq AI API key | Required |
| `DEFAULT_SALARY` | Base monthly salary | 8000 |
| `REQUIRED_DAYS_PER_MONTH` | Required working days | 26 |
| `PORT` | Server port | 5000 |

### Salary Calculation Logic

```javascript
const salaryPercentage = (daysPresent / requiredDays) * 100;
const calculatedSalary = (daysPresent / requiredDays) * baseSalary;
```

- Base salary: ‚Çπ8,000/month
